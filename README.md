Hello Sir/ma’am. I have succesfully recreated the homepage of Apple website with a responsive mobile friendly layout.

i have tried my best to achieve all the goals and objectives of the assignment like;

1}The website should have a navbar & a footer 2}Make use of flexbox/css grids for layout 3}Hover/Click interactions for buttons, links etc should be present 4}The website should be responsive

TO complete this assignment i used VS Code as my code editor TECH USED-HTML,CSS AND JAVASCRIPT

FOR IMAGES I USED GOOGLE TO FIND A PERFECT IMAGE INSTEAD OF APPLE WEBSITE. USED MEDIA QUERIES FOR THE RESPONSIVE LOOK INCLUDED NAVBAR WITH ANIMATION FOR SMALL DEVICES INCLUDED ORIGINAL FOOTER OF APPLE’S WEBSITE WITH ALL IMPORTANT DETAILS.
